# **My understanding of the "Growth Mindset"**

Growth mindset describes how you view challenges and obstacles in your life.
With a fixed mindset, you believe that your talents, intellect, and abilities are non-changing. 
However, with a growth mindset you continue to develop yourself even when faced with problems that seem out of your scope.

## *Three reminders to sustain a Growth Mindset*

* Remind yourself that skills aren't inherent
* Recognize when you're avoiding growth 
* Create a motto that resonates with you    

### A little about me

My name is Autumn, and I'm originally from Detroit, Michigan. I joined this program with the hope to start a new career as a software engineer. I am excited and a little afraid, but mostly so grateful for this oppourtnity and the support I've received. If you'd like to see more of my work, here's a link to my page
