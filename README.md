# **My understanding of the "Growth Mindset"

Growth mindset describes how you view challenges and obstacles in your life.
With a fixed mindset, you believe that your talents, intellect, and abilities are non-changing. 
However, with a growth mindset you continue to develop yourself even when faced with problems that seem out of your scope.

## *Three reminders to sustain a Growth Mindset*

* Remind yourself that skills aren't inherent
* Recognize when you're avoiding growth 
* Create a motto that resonates with you
