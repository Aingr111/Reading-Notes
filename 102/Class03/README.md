## What is version Control?



Version control is like a database that stores current and past versions of a file.



 ### What are the differences between local version control, centralized version control, and Distributed version control?



 A local version control is one database that stores file changes on your hard drive. While a CVC is a single server that multiple people can access and work on to collaborate on the same project. A DVCS has the added feature of cloned repositories. This allows work to be backed up in multiple ways, in case a server was to go down. It also allows collaborators to work together on the same files and merge later before submitting changes.



 #### So what is Git?



 Git is a Distributed Version Control System


 ##### How do you know if a file has been saved in Git? 



 Files  will be marked in git to tell you the status. If a file has been committed, it is stored in a local database. However if there is a "M" next to the file..it has been changed/modified and hasn't been committed/saved just yet.



 ###### How do you set up a Git Repo? 

 You can either import your file/directory or you can clone an existing repo. 

 What are the steps to saving, and uploading a file?

 First, you want to save your file after you've modified it in any way. Then you want to head over to github desktop and write what changes you made and why. After yoyu want to commit changes and then you want to "push" those changes to your website.
