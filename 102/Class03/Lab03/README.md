# What did this assignment teach me?

This assignment taught me so many things. I learned how to assemble a directory, which I learned is basically just a

 file within a folder, sometimes within another folder. I learned how to link items that do not have a URL using 
 
 paths. I also learned what an absolute path format should look like when creating links. I learned about the use for 
 
 a read me file as it pertains to building a websit. I also learned how to clone a repo, commit updated work, push it 
 
 to github, and track the process of the update through github. I also learned the importance of catching typos when 

working within VS. Technically unrelated, but I also learned the important of asking for help.
