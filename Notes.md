# Assignment Number 2

Today I learned about the basic language used on markdown applications. This is important because it's one of the foundational coding languages, so it provides a basic level of understanding. I'll go a little in depth here about how to create headings, paragraphs, & creating emphasis using markdown applications. 

## Headings

To make a heading, all that is needed is a number sign "#" in front of your heading title. Such as, "# Title One"

If you have multiple titles, you just add additional number signs that correlates with that heading title placement. For example, "Heading title 4" would look like "#### Heading title 4".

### Paragraphs

I also learned how to create paragraphs. To do so, you just need to create blank spaces in your code to denote paragraphs. You can do this bty simply pressing the enter button a few times on your keyboard. Such as, "Today I really enjoyed class"


"Tomorrow I hope there is a lecture to better explain material"

#### Using Emphhasis
